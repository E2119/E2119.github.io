Step 4: Construct and publish presentations of the process and the results of analysis. 
Fisr of all I spent a lot of hours to find the best dataset on investigation but finally I decided to work with the cheapest electric car in 2023. And really give a good data set also I am interested in that data set. The data set has a lot of information by the columns like the name of the car, model, battery capacity, top speed, acceleration, efficiency, and etc.  I am interested in working on electric vehicles, so I decided to get specific data to make a good topic: Cheapest Electric Cars 2023. Yes, that is my appropriate data. Then I Formulated one or more questions to be investigated via data analysis. When I looked at my dataset from my speed sheet I had 4 questions to investigate the data then I decided to choose only 2 questions for my investigation on this data analysis. Here is my 2 basic questions :
 Do electric vehicles with larger battery capacities tend to have quicker acceleration? 
Do vehicles with higher speeds tend to have lower efficiency ratings?
And here my answer for the top of the questions 
When I looked at the database analysis for my spreadsheet I tried to see how large battery capacity has a tendency relation to acceleration. There is no relation between the larger battery and acceleration. 
 From my spreadsheet In general, vehicles with higher or top speeds tend to have lower efficiency ratings. But sometimes it is unconstant.in my  hypothesis there is correlation between them.
Sources: To conduct the analysis on whether the cheapest electric car 2023 a variety of sources can be utilized. These may include my database on my spreadsheet from when I download kaggle. Examples of relevant sources include “car and driver”. 
So my Downloading and formatting just use a comma- separated value ( CSV) from my kaggle account. Then my Analytical tools: While this topic may not require extensive data analysis, so I can use basic analytical tools such as spreadsheets like excel then i used that. The next one is my documentation tool. Google docs are good and simple to use. Then I am going to upload with my github pages.
